      "body": "Co-op boss says sorry to 6.5m people who had data stolen in hack 12 minutes ago Share Save Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter Share Save Getty Images The chief executive of Co-op has confirmed all 6.5 million of its members had their data stolen in a cyber-attack on the retailer in April. \"I'm devastated that information was taken. I'm also devastated by the impact that it took on our colleagues as well as they tried to contain all of this,\" Shirine Khoury-Haq told BBC Breakfast in her first public interview since the hack. \"There was no financial data, no transaction data but it was names and addresses and contact information that was lost,\" she added. Ms Khoury-Haq said she would not step down from her role, but said she was \"incredibly sorry\" for the attack. Co-op was one of three retailers, alongside Marks and Spencer (M&S) and Harrods who were victims of cyber-attacks in spring this year. Co-op announced on 30 April that it had been hacked, initially saying it would only have a \"small impact\" on its call centre and back office. But days later, after being contacted by the alleged hackers, BBC News revealed that customer and employee data had been accessed. Co-op then admitted the criminals had \"accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members\". BBC News later discovered from the alleged attackers that the company disconnected the internet from IT networks in the nick of time to stop the hackers from deploying ransomware and so causing even more disruption. M&S also had customer data stolen , and is still getting its systems back to normal after huge disruption which has cost it millions of pounds. Last week, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said four people had been arrested in connection with the hacks on Co-op and M&S These were a 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, and three males - aged between 17 and 19 - were detained in London and the West Midlands. They were apprehended on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering and participating in the activities of an organised crime group.

      "body": "WeTransfer says files not used to train AI after backlash 19 hours ago Share Save Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter Share Save Getty Images WeTransfer has confirmed it does not use files uploaded to their service to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. The file sharing company had received lots of criticism from customers on social media after changing its terms of service, which some interpreted as allowing it the right to use files for AI training. A WeTransfer spokeswoman told BBC News: \"We don't use machine learning or any form of AI to process content shared via WeTransfer, nor do we sell content or data to any third parties.\" The firm has now updated its terms, saying it has \"made the language easier to understand\" to avoid confusion. WeTransfer said the clause was initially added to \"include the possibility of using AI to improve content moderation\" and to identify harmful content. The terms had said WeTransfer could use content for purposes \"including to improve performance of machine learning models that enhance our content moderation process\". It also included the right for WeTransfer to \"reproduce, distribute, modify,\" or \"publicly display\" files uploaded to the service. Some users on social media interpreted this as WeTransfer giving itself the right to share or sell the files uploaded by users to AI companies. People working in the creative industries, including an illustrator and an actor , posted on X to say they used the service to send work and were considering changing to alternative providers. WeTransfer said it updated the clause on Tuesday, \"as we've seen this passage may have caused confusion for our customers.\" Clause 6.3 in the terms of service now says: \"You hereby grant us a royalty-free license to use your Content for the purposes of operating, developing, and improving the Service, all in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.\" The changes come into effect on 8 August for existing users. The rival file-sharing platform Dropbox also had to clarify it was not using files uploaded to its service to train AI models, after social media outcry in December 2023. Tech outlet The Register commented at the time that even though the claim turned out not to be true, the fact that there was such a strong reaction against it showed a lack of trust in tech companies by their users. Mona Schroedel, a data protection specialist lawyer at Freeths, told BBC News terms of service and privacy policy changes \"can come with hidden risks\". \"All companies are keen to cash in on the AI craze and what AI needs more than anything is data,\" she said. \"So it is a skip and a hop to trying to use existing data for machine learning exercises under the guise of legitimate interest to improve service provision.\" Users can also be placed in a \"difficult position\" if terms of a service they are embedded in or rely on suddenly change, she added, saying they may be left with little choice but to continue using it.

      "body": "New AI voice tool trained to copy British regional accents 1 day ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman Technology editor â€¢ @zsk Share Save Getty Images A new AI voice-cloning tool from a British firm claims to be able to reproduce a range of UK accents more accurately than some of its US and Chinese rivals. Because much of the data traditionally used to train AI products with voices comes from North American or southern English speaking sources, many artificial voices tend to sound similar. To combat this, the company Synthesia spent a year compiling its own database of UK voices with regional accents, through recording people in studios and gathering online material. It used those to train a product called Express-Voice, which can clone a real person's voice or generate a synthetic voice. These can be used in content such as training videos, sales support and presentations. The company said its customers wanted more accurate regional representations. \"If you're the CEO of a company, or if you're just a regular person, when you have your likeness, you want your accent to be preserved,\" said Synthesia Head of Research Youssef Alami Mejjati. He added French-speaking customers had also commented that synthetic French voices tended to sound French-Canadian rather than originating from France. \"This is just because the companies building these models tend to be North American companies, and they tend to have datasets that are biased towards the demographics that they're in,\" he said. The hardest accents to mimic are the least common, Mr Mejjati said, because there is less recorded material available to train an AI model. There are also reports that voice-prompted AI products, such as smart speakers, are more likely to struggle to understand a range of accents. Last year, internal documents from West Midlands Police revealed worries about whether voice recognition systems would understand Brummie accents. Meanwhile the US-based start-up Sanas is taking the opposite approach, developing tools for deployment in call centres which \"neutralise\" the accents of Indian and Filipino staff, as reported by Bloomberg in March. The firm says it aims to reduce \"accent discrimination\" experienced by workers when callers fail to understand them. Endangered languages and dialects There is concern that languages and dialects are being lost in the digital era. \"Among the over seven thousand languages that still exist today, almost half are endangered according to UNESCO; about a third have some online presence; less than 2 percent are supported by Google Translate; and according to OpenAI's own testing, only fifteen, or 0.2 percent are supported by GPT-4 [an OpenAI model] above an 80 percent accuracy,\" writes Karen Hao in the book Empire of AI. \"Language models are homogenising speech,\" agrees AI expert Henry Ajder, who advises governments and tech firms, including Synthesia. However, the better these products become, the more effective they will also be in the hands of scammers. Synthesia's product will not be free when it is released in the coming weeks, and will have guardrails around hate speech and explicit material. But there are already many free, open-source voice-cloning tools which are easily accessible and less protected. At the beginning of July, messages generated by an AI-cloned voice impersonating US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were reported to have been sent to ministers. \"The open source landscape for voice has evolved so rapidly over the last nine to 12 months,\" Mr Ajder adds. \"And that, from a safety perspective, is a real concern.\" Council AI helper struggling to grasp local dialect 'My new voice is a dream come true' Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

      "body": "Nvidia says it will restart AI chip sales to China 1 day ago Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter, BBC News Reporting from Singapore Share Save Getty Images Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang is currently in China US technology giant Nvidia says it will soon resume sales of its high-end artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. The US government has assured the firm that it will grant the licenses needed to restart exports to the world's second largest economy, the company said in a blog post . The move reverses a ban on sales of Nvidia's H20 chips to Beijing, which was imposed by US President Donald Trump's administration in April over concerns that they could be used by the Chinese military. The chips have been a key focus of export controls aimed at keeping the cutting-edge technology out of Beijing's hands as the AI race between the US and China heats up. The US Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The H20 chip was developed specifically for the Chinese market after US export restrictions were imposed by the Biden administration in 2023. Its sale was effectively banned by the Trump administration in April this year. The announcement came as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have been easing. In May, the two governments agreed a temporary truce in their tariffs war. They set a 12 August deadline to reach a longer term deal over the high tariffs imposed on each other since Trump returned to the White House this year. In recent weeks, Beijing has relaxed trade controls on rare earth exports, while the US has lifted restrictions on chip design software firms operating in China. Nvidia has long viewed China as a crucial market, with the country ranking among its top buyers globally. Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang has spent months lobbying both sides for a resumption of sales of H20 chips in China. The company said that Mr Huang, who is currently in China, met Trump to reaffirm Nvidia's commitment to create jobs and ensure the US leads in AI worldwide. Mr Huang also met Chinese government and industry officials to discuss how AI can raise productivity and ways to advance research safely.

      "body": "Meta to spend hundreds of billions to build AI data centres 1 day ago Share Save Helen Sullivan BBC News Share Save Reuters Meta's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said the social media giant will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building huge AI data centres in the US. The first multi-gigawatt data centre, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, Zuckerberg said. He said one of the sites would cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan (59.1 sq km/22.8 sq miles). Meta has invested heavily in efforts to develop what it called \"superintelligence\" - technology that it said could out-think the smartest humans. The company, which has made most of its money from online advertising, generated more than $160bn in revenue in 2024. In a post on his social media platform, Threads, Zuckerberg said Meta was building several multi-gigawatt clusters, and that one cluster, called Hyperion, could scale up to five gigawatts over several years. \"We're building multiple more titan clusters as well. Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" he added. Prometheus will be built in New Albany, Ohio, while Hyperion will be built in Louisiana and is expected to be fully online by 2030, Zuckerberg said. He said Meta would \"invest hundreds of billions of dollars... to build superintelligence\" and that the centres had been given \"names befitting their scale and impact\". Karl Freund, principal analyst at Cambrian AI Research, told the BBC, \"clearly, Zuckerberg intends to spend his way to the top of the AI heap\". \"The talent he is hiring will have access to some of the best AI Hardware in the world,\" Freund added. Meta shares were trading 1% higher following the announcement, Reuters news agency reported. The stock has risen more than 20% so far this year. There are at least 10,000 data centres around the world hosting the cloud - remote servers that store digital information - with most of them located in the US, followed by the UK and Germany. AI-driven data centres are extremely energy and water intensive. One study estimates that these centres could consume 1.7 trillion gallons of water globally by 2027.

      "body": "Reddit starts verifying ages of users in the UK 24 hours ago Share Save Dearbail Jordan Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Reddit has introduced age verification on its UK site to stop people aged under 18 from looking at \"certain mature content\". The social media platform brought in the measures to comply with new rules under the UK's Online Safety Act which require sites that show adult material to introduce \"robust\" age checking techniques. Reddit, known for its online communities and discussions, said that while it does not want to know who its audience is: \"It would be helpful for our safety efforts to be able to confirm whether you are a child or an adult.\" Ofcom, the UK regulator, said: \"We expect other companies to follow suit, or face enforcement if they fail to act.\" Reddit said that from 14 July, an outside firm called Persona will perform age verification for the social media platform either through an uploaded selfie or \"a photo of your government ID\", such as a passport. It said Reddit will not have access to the photo and will only retain a user's verification status and date of birth so people do not have to re-enter it each time they try to access restricted content. Reddit added that Persona \"promises not to retain the picture for longer than seven days\" and will not have access to a user's data on the site. The new rules in the UK come into force on 25 July. A spokesperson for Ofcom said: \"Society has long protected youngsters from products that aren't suitable for them, from alcohol to smoking or gambling. \"Now, children will be better protected from online material that's not appropriate for them, while adults' rights to access legal content are preserved.\" But Scott Babwah Brennen, director of the Center on Technology Policy at New York University, said: \"There's always going to be ways that kids can get around it and there's always going to be concerns about who's collecting personal or sensitive information, and how long are they holding it.\" David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the UK's Online Safety Act was a \"real tragedy\". \"UK users can no longer use the internet without having to provide their papers, as it were,\" he said, adding that he was disappointed websites like Reddit were not legally challenging the law. Pornhub and a number of other major adult websites recently confirmed they would introduce enhanced age checks in time for the new rules. Pornhub's parent company, Aylo, said it would bring in \"government approved age assurance methods\" but is yet to reveal how it will require users to prove they are over 18. Ofcom has previously said simply clicking a button, which is all the adult site currently requires, is not enough. Companies that fail to meet the rules face fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of worldwide revenue, \"whichever is greater\". It added that in the most serious cases, it can seek a court order for \"business disruption measures\", such as requiring payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from a platform, or requiring Internet Service Providers to block access to a site in the UK.\" Pornhub to introduce 'government approved' age checks in UK How can you keep your child safe online?

A spokesperson for Flutter Entertainment, which owns the online gambling brands, confirmed to the BBC it had \"suffered a data incident.\" Some personal information including IP addresses, email addresses, and online activity data has been compromised. The company provided affected users with online safety information and told them: \"There is nothing you need to do in response to this incident, however we recommend you remain vigilant.\" Flutter Entertainment has 4.2 million average monthly players across all its brands in the UK and Ireland. Its other betting companies include Sky Bet and Tombola. The company said the incident has now been contained and added: \"No passwords, ID documents or usable card or payment details were impacted.\" However, cybersecurity experts have warned the breached data could be used to target unsuspecting customers with convincing personal emails in what's known as a spear phishing attack. Harley Morlet, chief marketing officer at Storm Guidance, said individuals that spend large amounts of money with these gambling companies could be targets. \"With the advent of AI, I think it would actually be very easy to build out a large-scale automated attack,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"Basically, focusing on crafting messages that look appealing to those gamblers.\" Tim Rawlins, director and senior adviser at global security firm the NCC Group, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme that customers should look out for detailed emails that might refer to their previous betting habits, encourage them to click links or give away credit card information. \"You might re-enter your credit card number, you might re-enter your bank account details, those are the sort of things people need to be on the look out for and be conscious of that sort of threat,\" he said. He added: \"If it's too good to be true, it probably is a fraudster who's coming after your money.\" Mr Rawlins said his security firm has seen an increase in the quality of phishing emails and said AI is making it harder to tell a fraudulent email from a real message.

      "body": "Heat pump makers are ready for a rush: Will customers come? 1 day ago Share Save Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter Share Save Chris Baraniuk Octopus makes heat pumps at its factory in Northern Ireland On the day I visit Octopus Energy's heat pump factory in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, temperatures in London reached 29C . Some of the staff meeting me, who are usually based in the south of England, are beaming. It's wonderful to escape the heat, they say. And who can blame them. Climate change is making the UK hotter . In order to do something about that, decarbonising our energy systems â€“ including domestic heating â€“ is becoming more and more urgent. Heat pumps run on electricity, not oil or gas, and Octopus is manufacturing heat pumps of its own design right here in Northern Ireland. \"It kind of gets harder as you go up â€“ it's like levels in a game,\" says Patrick Doran, one of the workers here, after I view the production line. He's referring to how, in just under a year, he's completed training in each stage of the manufacturing process. From fitting pipework to attaching bundles of cables, which connect up the heat pump's internal electronics. \"I get to do something different every day,\" enthuses Doran. The government wants to see 600,000 heat pumps going in to UK homes annually by 2028, just three years away. While installations have quickened recently , the country remains far behind that target. Total UK heat pump sales were slightly below 100,000 in 2024. Demand for heat pumps boomed in Europe when gas prices spiralled following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 â€“ but that enthusiasm has since cooled . Gas has become slightly cheaper again meaning that heat pumps are finding it harder to compete against gas boilers in terms of running costs. This factory, in a medium-sized warehouse, can churn out 600 heat pumps per month, I'm told â€“ and this will soon double when a second production line becomes active. And in principle, Octopus could introduce additional shifts here and make many times that number of units. If higher demand materialises. \"We can have a plug-and-play solution that works in the majority of homes in the UK,\" says Aimee Clark, head of commercial, as she explains why Octopus wanted to manufacture its own heat pump â€“ which is unusual among electricity providers, to say the least. Chris Baraniuk Octopus heat pumps have an unusual design Other heat pump makers, including Vaillant, have UK manufacturing sites. And Copeland, which makes heat pumps components, has a factory here in Northern Ireland. It supplies compressors to Octopus. Heat pumps work by absorbing heat from the environment, usually the air. It's a way of harvesting free heat, if you like. Ambient heat causes a refrigerant inside the heat pump to warm up and expand. A compressor squeezes that refrigerant, raising its temperature yet further. Finally, a heat exchanger transfers this heat to water that gets pumped around your radiators, for instance. The Octopus heat pumps sport an unusual design. They come in a dark grey plastic casing. I have to admit, to me, it looks a little bit dour â€“ but it packs some original tech. Mateusz Dewhurst, director of manufacturing, points out an internal metal plate the company has patented â€“ refrigerant flows through this plate, absorbing heat from the machine's electronics and cooling them down. \"That's a performance gain,\" says Mr Dewhurst. He also says the heat pump's casing contains small grey insulation beads to reduce heat loss from the system. Exactly the same kind of beads that are sometimes used to insulate cavity walls in buildings, he explains. Chris Baraniuk Octopus can track the performance of a heat pump with internal sensors Heat pump technology has been around since the 1800s . Zhiwei Ma at Durham University says manufacturing these devices is relatively straightforward â€“ he made one himself when he was a PhD student. \"It worked fine,\" he recalls. Companies such as Octopus are able to buy in the main components and assemble a finished product. \"There's very little room to improve anything,\" argues Dr Ma. Octopus would perhaps disagree. They say their design choices make a difference to overall performance, which the firm can track thanks to the many heat and pressure sensors it secretes within the device. Heat pumps can produce multiple kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity they consume, a ratio known as their co-efficient of performance (Cop). Ensuring the Cop is as high as possible really matters in terms of keeping running costs low. Octopus technicians can intervene should data from a heat pump's sensors indicate a severe dip in performance. And customers also get an overview of their heat pump's efficiency via a smartphone app. Getty Images Getting a heat pump installed correctly is key Ensuring that heat pumps are installed competently is paramount, says Steven Metcalf at the University of Warwick. He and colleagues occasionally work with Mitsubishi, which has a heat pump factory in Scotland. \"It could be the difference of a Cop of 2.5 versus 4 â€“ your bills will scale with that,\" he explains. \"It can be a huge penalty for getting a bad install.\" Public acceptance of heat pumps rests on people having confidence that switching to such a system won't turn out to be a massive headache â€“ though it's worth saying that, in other countries such as colder Norway, heat pumps have long been embraced by locals. Octopus says surveys of its customers suggest a majority find their heat pump costs the same or less than their old gas boiler, and provides heat that is just as comfortable if not more so. Taxing fossil fuels harder is one way to spur demand for domestic appliances that use electricity as an alternative, says Paul Kenny, director general of the European Heat Pump Association, an industry body. \"Right now what we have is factories that are at low capacity factors, they're idle or running well below what they could be running,\" he says, referring to the slackening demand for heat pumps in Europe at present. There could also be greater consistency regarding subsidies. Despite having the highest proportion of especially-polluting oil heating systems of any UK nation, Northern Ireland is the only region within the UK or Ireland that doesn't have a widely available grant to reduce the cost of a heat pump installation. I point out the irony, therefore, of making heat pumps here to TJ Root, Octopus's Cosy program director, after my factory tour. \"It's incredibly ironic,\" he agrees.

      "body": "From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean 2 days ago Share Save Liv McMahon, Joe Tidy & Brandon Drenon BBC News Share Save Getty Images Bitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (Â£89,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. But it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate. Worry not. If you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean. Bitcoin While many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the \"crypto capital of the world\" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a \"scam\". Its price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024. In mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets. But its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes. Seven wild moments from the turbulent story of Bitcoin Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve criticised Blockchain Blockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain. Bitcoin 'halving' The blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called \"miners\" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency. However, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. So roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin \"halving\" (or \"halvening\") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. This ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers. Are cryptocurrencies the future of money? Crypto Exchange A crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees. Crypto Wallet A crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage. Ethereum Ethereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy . What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies. A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. How big banks are becoming 'Bitcoin whales' Meme coins Meme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation. They are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng . But meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time. They can also be susceptible to \"rug pulls\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales. Some celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins. 'A mockery': Trump's meme-coin sparks anger in crypto world Online star Hawk Tuah girl faces crypto coin criticism Stablecoins \"Stable\" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value. This typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets. Stablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability. Cryptocurrency firm Terraform, behind the crashed TerraUSD and Luna tokens, files for bankruptcy XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency used by a platform called the XRP Ledger. It was created by the co-founders of financial services company Ripple Labs in 2012 as a cheaper, faster alternative to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 100 billion coins, which were created when it launched. Much of it is held by Ripple and periodically released into circulation. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, transactions made using XRP are verified through consensus - whereby the majority of validators on its peer-to-peer network must agree whether or not a transaction is valid before it is added to its blockchain. This has been credited with allowing many transactions to take place simultaneously, at high speed and low cost - making it appealing to financial institutions or for processes like cross-border payments. But as with other cryptocurrencies, XRP has received regulatory scrutiny and seen sudden, sharp declines in value .

      "body": "More rules being considered to keep children safe online 3 days ago Share Save Paul Seddon Political reporter Share Save Watch: New Ofcom rules \"foundation\" for safer internet but \"not end of the conversation\" says Heidi Alexander The government is considering further action to keep children safe online and will not \"sit back and wait\" on the issue, a cabinet minister has said. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC new age-verification rules beginning later this month would have a \"really important\" impact. She said the regulations, to be overseen by media regulator Ofcom, would not be the \"end of the conversation\" on online safety. Ofcom boss Melanie Dawes vowed to rigorously enforce the new requirements, adding the regulator \"means business\". But she acknowledged Ofcom may require further legal powers in order to keep pace with the rapidly developing impact of artificial intelligence (AI). How can you keep your child safe online? Dads call for ban on smartphones in schools Under new powers introduced by the Online Safety Act and passed under the previous Tory government, Ofcom will require internet companies to conduct stricter age verification methods to check whether a user is under 18. A new code of practice, to apply from 25 July, will also require platforms to change algorithms affecting what is shown in children's feeds to filter out harmful content. At the last election, Labour committed to \"build on\" the previous government's law and consider further measures to keep children safe. But it is yet to publish fresh legislation of its own, with ministers arguing the existing set of new regulations need to be rolled out first. Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the new rules should mark the \"biggest moment in online safety\" since the arrival of social media. But he added the \"proof of the pudding is in what happens,\" adding he thought Ofcom could go further than it has done within the legal powers it has acquired. He also argued that the regulator should be prepared to \"push back\" against ministers over \"weaknesses\" in the legislation. 'Addictive habits' Alexander said the new rules would bring in \"really robust safeguards\" to ensure proper age verification. But she added: \"We are very clear as a government that this is the foundation for a safer online experience for children, but it is not the end of the conversation\". She said Technology Secretary Peter Kyle was looking at further action in a number of areas, including how to address \"addictive habits\" among children. \"We're not going to be a government that sits back and waits on this, we want to address it,\" she added. She did not provide further details, but Kyle has previously indicated he wants to curb the \"addictive nature\" of apps and smartphones for children. Proposals under consideration include a two-hour cap on the use of individual social media apps, and a 22:00 curfew. Phone ban calls Alexander added that the education secretary was reviewing guidance in England that allows individual headteachers to ban smartphones in schools. The government has so far stopped short of legislating for a nationwide ban, voting down a Tory attempt to do so in March. The transport secretary added that it was important to \"get the balance right\" on the issue, noting that some parents \"want their kids to have a phone on their way to school\". Shadow minister Chris Philp said he wished the previous Tory government had legislated to ban smartphones in schools during its 14 years in power. He told Kuenssberg it was a \"great shame\" Labour had not backed a ban, adding: \"As a dad myself, I am really concerned about this\". Ofcom's chief executive told the programme the new rules would mean tech platforms would have to change their content algorithms \"very significantly\". Ms Dawes said the regulator would give websites some flexibility when deciding which age-verification tools to use, but pledged that those failing to put adequate checks in place \"will hear from us with enforcement action\". However, she acknowledged some newer forms of AI \"may not\" be covered be powers contained in the existing legislation. \"There may need to be some changes to the legislation to cover that,\" she added.
