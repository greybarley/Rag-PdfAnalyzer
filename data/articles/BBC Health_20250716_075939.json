Here showing images of the abdomen and major organs Scientists say they can study our bodies as we age in greater detail than ever before, thanks to more than a billion scans of UK volunteers. The world's biggest human imaging project says it has now hit its target of scanning the brains, hearts and other organs of 100,000 people - the culmination of an ambitious 11-year study. \"Researchers are already starting to use the imaging data, along with other data we have, to identify disease early and then target treatment at an earlier stage,\" says Prof Naomi Allen, chief scientist at UK Biobank. The data is made available at low cost to teams around the world to find new ways of preventing common health conditions from heart disease to cancer. The 100,000th volunteer to be scanned was Steve, who recently retired from a job in sales and now helps out at a charity run by his daughter. The BBC watched as he entered a full-body MRI scanner in an industrial park outside Reading, and detailed images of brain cells, blood vessels, bones and joints appeared on the screens. \"My mum was diagnosed with early-stage dementia a few years ago and has not been well,\" he says. \"So with that in mind I want to give more back to research so the next generation can learn from people like me.\" Steve from southern England was the 100,000th person scanned in what's become the world's largest medical imaging project The giant medical imaging project has been running for 13 hours a day, seven-days-a-week across four sites in England. Participants are given a five-hour appointment to be scanned using five different types of MRI, X-ray and ultrasound machines. The data gathered is anonymised and volunteers like Steve receive no individual feedback unless the radiographers happen to spot a potentially serious health problem. The project does not allow personal data, such as a volunteer's surname or the precise area where they live, to be published. What is UK Biobank? UK Biobank / Dave Guttridge Volunteers have been scanned at four sites across the UK over an 11-year period Launched in 2003, UK Biobank is one of the largest collections of biological samples and health data in the world. In total, half a million people – all middle-aged volunteers – have been asked to complete physical tests, answer regular health and lifestyle questions, and provide DNA and other biological samples. Their blood, urine and saliva are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at temperatures of -80C (-112F) in huge refrigerators in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The imaging part of the project began in 2014, and involves taking detailed scans of 100,000 of those same participants. All of that group will be invited back to repeat the process every few years to see how their bodies and organs change as they grow older. By combining those scans with the other data collected by UK Biobank, scientists can test whether early changes to the make-up of the brain or body then lead to diseases or other health problems in later life. The whole UK Biobank project, which is non-profit making, was set up by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Wellcome Trust charity, along with the Department of Health and the Scottish government. Two decades later it is now reaching maturity. Over 30 petabytes, or 30,000 terabytes, of anonymised health data is already available to researchers working for universities, charities, governments and the private sector. Scientists in the UK and the rest of the world can apply for access and most are charged between £3,000 and £9,000 to help cover running costs. DNA store has 'revolutionary' effect -scientists Genetics data release 'could lead to better treatment' UK biobank opens to researchers Louise Thomas, professor of metabolic imaging at the University of Westminster, says it is \"completely transforming\" how she and other researchers do their jobs. \"We thought it was a crazy idea, there was absolutely no way anybody could scan this number of people,\" she says. \"To analyse these images manually would have taken us thousands of years but now... we can extract all the information automatically, so we can measure everything in the body in a matter of minutes.\" Researchers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to process the huge amounts of data generated by the project. Almost 17,000 peer-reviewed papers have been written using all types of Biobank data since work started in 2003, with dozens more now published every week. The scans and images taken so far have already been used to show that: The early onset of 38 common diseases can be predicted by combining MRI scans with other health data and an artificial intelligence (AI) model Consumption of just small amounts of alcohol each day can be linked to an increased risk of memory loss and dementia A detailed MRI scan can replace surgery to diagnose and monitor a common form of liver disease Changes to the structure of the heart may lead to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders including depression UK Biobank is one of the 10 largest stores of personal health data in the world alongside similar initiatives in Germany, China and the United States, although those projects don't all make their data available to scientists globally in the same way. The imaging element of the project is funded by the MRC, the Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation. Extra backing for repeat scans is paid for by Calico, a subsidiary of Alphabet which also owns Google, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan.

      "title": "Why are resident doctors striking and what are they paid?",
      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0qyl4ljjko",
      "body": "Why are resident doctors striking and what are they paid? 2 days ago Share Save Share Save Getty Images Resident doctors in England are planning a walkout for five consecutive days from 25 July, over a pay dispute with the government. They say they haven't had a \"credible pay deal\" for 2025-2026, but Health Secretary Wes Streeting argues the strike is \"unreasonable\" after substantial pay rises in recent years. Resident doctors in England to strike for five days in July What are resident doctors' pay demands? The British Medical Association (BMA), a trade union for doctors, says resident doctors' pay will be 20% lower in real terms than it was in 2008, even after an increase in August. The BMA wants pay for the group - who used to be known as junior doctors - to be brought back in line with the level it was at 17 years ago, when they say their pay started to be eroded. The claim is based on a measure of inflation called the Retail Price Index (RPI). This includes housing costs and shows higher price increases than some other inflation measures. The BMA points out that many resident doctors have large student loans and that interest on these is calculated using RPI. However, the government says RPI is outdated. Instead, it uses the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to calculate inflation and pay increases. CPI looks at the cost of goods and services based on a basket of household items. Using the CPI measure, the government says resident doctors' current pay is fair. Analysis from the Nuffield Trust - a health think tank - suggests pay has fallen 5% since 2008 if CPI is used, compared with nearly 20% for RPI. What pay rises have resident doctors had and what do they earn? Since 2023, resident doctors have taken part in 11 separate strikes, arguing for fairer pay and working conditions. During 2023-24, over two years, they received a 22% pay increase. From August this year, they will get an additional 5.4% pay rise . Health Secretary Wes Streeting says resident doctors have received the largest pay rises of any public sector employees over the last three years. The government says it won't be offering any further increases. During their first foundation year after finishing their medical degree resident doctors in England earn a basic salary of £38,831, for an average of 48 hours worked per week. In the second year, this rises to £44,439. Medics are often expected to work nightshifts, weekends and longer hours for extra payments. After eight years as a resident doctor, salaries can progress to around £70,000. What pay rises have people in other jobs had? In May, the government announced pay rises for a number of public sector workers, including: 4% for other doctors, dentists, and teachers in England, as well as prison officers in England and Wales a 3.25% rise for civil servants a 3.6% rise for some NHS staff in England, including nurses and midwives a 4.5% rise for members of the UK armed forces, with 3.75% for senior military staff However, the BMA argues that resident doctors may have built up more student debt than people working in other jobs. A medical degree can take five or six years to complete - longer than most other degree courses. Resident doctors also say they have little control on where and when they are asked to work. And it can be difficult to put down roots, because of the need to do placements in different parts of the country. How will patients be affected by the resident doctors' strike? The medics will stage a walkout in England from 07:00 on 25 July until 07:00 on 30 July. NHS leaders have warned that patient care will be disrupted if the strike goes ahead. On strike days, more senior doctors are likely to end up working in emergency and urgent care to replace striking resident doctors. As a result, many planned operations will have to be cancelled. There were 507,000 appointments and operations cancelled and rescheduled because of strikes by doctors (some including consultants) between July 2023 and February 2024, according to government analysis. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of having \"boasted that he solved the doctors' strike\" only for them to take further action, adding that he'd been \"weak\" in dealing with the medics. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not affected by these strikes.

      "body": "Woman smuggled baby into UK using fake birth story 2 days ago Share Save Sanchia Berg News correspondent Tara Mewawalla BBC News Share Save Getty Images Last summer, a woman was arrested at Gatwick Airport after she arrived from Nigeria with a very young baby girl. The woman had been living in West Yorkshire with her husband and children, and before leaving the UK for Africa had told her GP she was pregnant. That was not true. When the woman returned about a month later with the baby, she was arrested on suspicion of trafficking. The case, the second the BBC has followed through the Family Court in recent months, reveals what experts say is a worrying trend of babies possibly being brought to the UK unlawfully - some from so-called \"baby factories\" in Nigeria. 'My babies are always hidden' The woman, who we are calling Susan, is Nigerian, but had been living in England since June 2023, with her husband and children. A careworker with leave to remain in Britain, Susan claimed she was pregnant. But scans and blood tests showed that wasn't true. Instead, they revealed Susan had a tumour, which doctors feared could be cancerous. But she refused treatment. Susan insisted her previous pregnancies had been invisible on scans, telling her employer, \"my babies are always hidden\". She also claimed she'd been pregnant for up to 30 months with her other children. Susan had travelled to Nigeria in early June 2024, saying she wanted to have her baby there, and then contacted her local hospital in Britain, to say she had given birth. Doctors were concerned and contacted children's services. Arriving back in the UK with the baby girl - who we're calling Eleanor - Susan was stopped and arrested by Sussex Police. She was bailed and the lead police force on this confirmed there is no active investigation at the moment. After her arrest, Susan, her husband, and Eleanor were given DNA tests. Eleanor was taken to foster carers. \"When the results show that I am Eleanor's mother, I want her to be returned immediately,\" Susan said. But the tests showed the baby had no genetic link with Susan or her husband. Susan demanded a second test – which gave the same result, and then she changed her story. She'd had IVF treatment before moving to Britain in 2023 with a donor egg and sperm, she said, and that's why the DNA tests were negative. Susan provided a letter from a Nigerian hospital, signed by the medical director, saying she'd given birth there, as well as a document from another clinic about the IVF treatment to back up her claims. She also provided photos and videos which she said showed her in the Nigerian hospital's labour suite. No face is visible in the images and one showed a naked woman with a placenta between her legs, with an umbilical cord still attached to it. Alamy Someone had given birth - it wasn't Susan The Family Court in Leeds sent Henrietta Coker to investigate. Ms Coker, who provides expert reports to family courts in cases like this, has nearly 30 years experience as a social worker. She trained in Britain, and worked in front-line child protection in London, before moving to Africa. Ms Coker visited the medical centre where Susan claimed she'd had IVF. There was no record of Susan having had treatment there - staff told her the letter was forged. She then visited the place Susan said she'd given birth. It was a shabby, three bedroom flat, with \"stained\" walls and \"dirty\" carpets. There Ms Coker was met by \"three young teenage girls sitting in the reception room with nurses' uniforms on\". She asked to speak to the matron and was \"ushered into the kitchen where a teenage girl was eating rice\". Ms Coker then tracked down the doctor who'd written a letter saying Susan had given birth there. He said, \"Yes, someone had given birth\". Ms Coker showed him a photograph of Susan, but it wasn't her, the doctor said. \"Impersonating people is common in this part of the world,\" he told Ms Coker, suggesting that Susan might have \"bought the baby\". Supplied Henrietta Coker has decades of experience as a social worker The practice of \"baby farming\" is well known in West Africa, Ms Coker later told the court. At least 200 illegal \"baby factories\" have been shut down by the Nigerian authorities in the last five years, she said. Some contained young girls who'd been kidnapped, raped, and forced to give birth repeatedly. \"Sometimes these girls are released,\" Ms Coker said, \"other times they die during childbirth, or are murdered and placed in the grounds of the organisation.\" It's not clear where baby Eleanor might have come from – though the doctor told Ms Coker he believed she would have been given up voluntarily. Ms Coker was unable to establish who Eleanor's real parents are. She gave evidence to the Family Court in Leeds in March this year, along with Susan, her husband, her employer and a senior obstetrician. At an earlier hearing the judge asked for Susan's phone to be examined. Investigators found messages which Susan had sent to someone saved in her address book as \"Mum oft [sic] Lagos Baby\". About four weeks before the alleged date of birth Susan wrote a text message which read: \"Good afternoon ma, I have not seen the hospital items\" The same day, Mum Oft Lagos Baby responded: \"Delivery drug is 3.4 m \"Hospital bill 170k.\" Assuming those sums to be Nigerian Naira, they would be in the region of £1,700 and £85 respectively, the Family Court judge, Recorder William Tyler KC said. Getty Images The local authority pointed out the messages were set to \"automatic self-destruct mode\" – and said they represented evidence of a deal to purchase a baby. Susan tried to explain the messages in court. The Recorder said her attempts were \"difficult to follow and impossible to accept\". Recorder Tyler, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, found Susan had \"staged a scene\" which she falsely claimed showed her giving birth to Eleanor in Nigeria. He said Susan and her husband had put forward a \"fundamental lie\" to explain how Eleanor came to be in their care, and had tried to mislead authorities with false documents. They'd both caused the little girl \"significant emotional and psychological harm\", he said. In early July, the BBC attended the final hearing in Eleanor's case, held remotely. In one little square of the Teams meeting we could see Susan and her husband, sitting upright, barely moving, focused closely on what the advocates said. They wanted Eleanor returned to them. Their barristers said their own children were thriving - they wanted to offer her the same love and care. Susan's husband saw Eleanor as \"a fundamental part of their family unit\". Vikki Horspool, representing the child's guardian, a social worker from the Independent Children and Family Child Advisory Service challenged that. She said that the couple \"continued to be dishonest\" about Eleanor's real start in life and how she came to be in their care. The judge ordered that baby Eleanor be placed for adoption, and also made a \"declaration of non parentage\". He said he was aware of the \"pain\" this would cause Susan and her husband. The barrister for the local authority told the court that the baby is \"very settled\" with her foster carer, taking part in activities in her community and getting medical treatment. When Eleanor is adopted she will have a new identity and British nationality - but she may never know who her real parents are. Eleanor's story echoes the case of \"Lucy\" – who was brought into Manchester Airport in 2023, by a man claiming to be her father. 'Money exchanged for children' Ms Coker believes it is likely that more children have been brought unlawfully to the UK from West Africa. She told the BBC she has worked on around a dozen similar cases since the pandemic. In her experience, baby trafficking is commonplace. \"Money is getting exchanged for children on a large scale\" she said - not just in Africa but \"across the global south\". Since 2021 the UK government has restricted adoptions from Nigeria, partly because of \"evidence of organised child trafficking\" within the country. British authorities have been aware of the problem for many years, and there have been several cases in the Family Courts over the last 20 years. Two hearings in 2011 and 2012 involved Nigerian couples who'd had \"fertility treatment \" that led to a \"miracle baby\". These \"treatments\" continue, as recently exposed by investigative journalists at BBC Africa Eye. In 2013, the UK High Commission in Lagos required DNA tests in certain circumstances before newborn babies could be taken from Nigeria to Britain. Among 12 couples investigated was a former Oxford academic, prosecuted for immigration offences. However this process has since stopped. In 2018 officials were advised that such DNA testing was unlawful. They were told they could not make people undergo DNA testing when they were asking for a visa or passport in support of an application relating to immigration status – and that had been the case since 2014. Ms Coker said some clinics offer \"packages\" that include registering the baby's birth. It will cost anywhere between £2,000 and £8,000, excluding any airfare, she said. She thinks more people in Britain should be aware of this activity. It is hard to tackle, she said - perhaps DNA testing of newborn babies and purported parents would help. But she wasn't sure the British government can do much to stop it, she said, \"the issues start in countries where the children are born\". Patricia Durr, CEO of the anti-trafficking charity ECPAT said cases like this were particularly \"heinous\" because they denied a child right to their identity. She said: \"Every effort must be made to prevent these egregious crimes occurring.\" A government spokesperson said: \"Falsely claiming to be the parent of a child to facilitate entry to the UK is illegal. Those found doing so will face the full force of the law. \"Border Force is committed to protecting individuals who cross the border and where concerns are raised, officers will take action to safeguard individuals who could be at risk.\" The BBC contacted the Nigerian High Commission for comment but they did not respond.

      "body": "Child dies at Alder Hey after contracting measles 3 days ago Share Save Stewart Whittingham & Ewan Gawne BBC News, Liverpool Share Save Getty Images Seventeen children have been treated at Alder Hey for the disease since June A child has died at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital after contracting measles, the BBC understands. The hospital said the highly contagious virus was on the rise among young people in the region and it had seen a surge in \"seriously unwell\" children being admitted. Alder Hey said it would not officially comment on individual cases to respect patient confidentiality but the death has been confirmed to the BBC. No official details have been released about whether the child was being treated for other health problems or their vaccination status. The Sunday Times has reported the child was ill with measles and other health issues . Seventeen children have been treated at Alder Hey for measles since June. The child, whose age and sex is unknown, is believed to be the second child in England to die in the past five years after contracting measles. Renae Archer, of Salford, Greater Manchester, died aged 10 in 2023 after complications from having measles as a baby. Her mother Rebecca, who has four other children, has been campaigning for parents to have their children vaccinated . She told BBC News: \"If other people were vaccinated, Renae might not have got the measles in the first place. She was only five months old. \"It's really scary, until it happens to your family, you don't realise the significance of getting vaccinated.\" PA Media There has been a spike in cases at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital An Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust spokesperson said: \"To respect patient confidentiality, we can't comment on individual cases. \"We are concerned about the increasing number of children and young people who are contracting measles. \"Measles is a highly contagious viral illness which can cause children to be seriously unwell, requiring hospital treatment, and in rare cases, death.\" Patients at the site include those with compromised immunity due to other health issues \"making them more susceptible to infections, including measles\", the spokesperson added. 'Spreads rapidly' The hospital warned parents earlier this week that a fall in measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake was behind the spike in cases in the region. Chief nurse Nathan Askew said he felt misunderstandings around the vaccine were to blame. \"This vaccine's been in use for well over 50 years. It's very safe, tried and tested,\" he said. There have been 500 cases of measles this year in England, with the rise blamed on the falling uptake of the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) wants 95% of children fully vaccinated by their fifth birthday. In the north-west of England the figure is 85%, with lower rates of 73% per cent in Liverpool and 75% Manchester, according to NHS data. Measles highest in 25 years in Europe, WHO says Measles holiday warning as cases rise in Europe Why are measles cases rising and what is the MMR vaccine? Consultant epidemiologist Dr Vanessa Saliba from the UK Health Security Agency said: \"Measles is one of the most highly infectious diseases and spreads rapidly among those who are unvaccinated. \"It is a particularly nasty disease for any child and sadly for some children can be serious, leading to complications especially in young infants and those with a weakened immune system, and on rare occasions can tragically cause death.\" Measles infections usually start with cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose and coughing and sneezing, according to the NHS. This is followed within days by a distinctive blotchy rash, which usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. A joint report by the WHO and the UN children's fund, Unicef, recently found that the number of measles cases in Europe has reached its highest level in 25 years. Professor Matthew Ashton, Liverpool director of public health, said one person with measles can infect 15 others. He said there was \"no link whatsoever\" between the MMR vaccine and autism and this claim had been disproved several times.

      "body": "Alzheimer's has isolated us, says Fiona Phillips' husband 4 days ago Share Save Cachella Smith BBC News Share Save Getty Images Fiona Phillips and Martin Frizell attend the Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2016 The husband of TV presenter Fiona Phillips says they have become socially isolated since her Alzheimer's diagnosis. Phillips, who hosted ITV's GMTV breakfast programme, announced in 2023 that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's the previous year, at the age of 61. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph , Martin Frizell, a former editor of ITV's This Morning show, said: \"You become almost invisible.\" He added: \"We still have some close friends. But I think people think, oh gosh, Fiona, maybe she doesn't look the same, or they don't know what to say, or it brings into sharp focus their own mortality.\" Fiona Phillips reveals she has Alzheimer's at 62 What is Alzheimer's and how common is it? At the time of her diagnosis, Phillips said she had suffered months of brain fog and anxiety - and initially had attributed the symptoms to the menopause. \"It's something I might have thought I'd get at 80,\" Phillips explained. \"But I was still only 61 years old.\" Mr Frizell said he now does not know what to do either with her cookery books or designer clothes - both things she no longer uses. \"Fiona hasn't cooked in two years,\" he said. \"Part of the heartache now is she's got this dressing room full of the most amazing clothes but this horrible disease means she's more than happy just wearing the same T-shirt, the same trousers, the same thing - day in, day out.\" Mother-of-two Phillips has written a memoir since her diagnosis, which is due to be released on Thursday. Mr Frizell contributed to the book, saying he had intended to write \"a few paragraphs\" but ended up writing \"24,000 words\". \"I started off writing about what a great woman she is and just how horrible it is and dreadfully unlucky that she is the latest in the long line of her family to get it,\" he told the Telegraph. \"Then I just got very angry as to what little support there is. As a family, we just kind of get through it and at some point we will need more support, but there's just nothing really.\" In 2023, Phillips said the disease had \"decimated\" her family - with her mother, father and uncle all receiving a diagnosis. She had cared for her parents and made two documentaries about the disease - one in 2009 called Mum, Dad, Alzheimer's and Me, about her family's history of dementia, and My Family and Alzheimer's in 2010. The NHS says the term dementia encompasses \"a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning\". Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK - but its exact cause is not yet fully understood. There is currently no cure for the disease, though some treatments can temporarily improve symptoms. One in three people born in the UK will be diagnosed with dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Society charity. Speaking to ITV's This Morning on Friday, Mr Frizell said: \"Society has decided we're not going to take it as seriously as we should. \"The money that's there for Alzheimer's research, it's like buying a Starbucks cup of coffee, basically trying to fight a disease. It's impossible.\" Phillips presented GMTV between 1993 and 2008. She has since led a number of documentaries and episodes of Panorama, and was a columnist for the Mirror.

      "body": "Vaccine roll-outs cut deaths by 60% - study 5 days ago Share Save Dominic Hughes Global Health Correspondent Share Save Getty Images The study examines the impact of emergency vaccine roll-outs for five major infectious diseases, including Ebola Emergency vaccination programmes – rolled out in response to outbreaks of five major diseases – are believed to have reduced deaths by around 60% over a period of 23 years, according to a new study . A similar number of infections are also thought to have been prevented. Researchers believe that vaccinations stopped much bigger outbreaks of illnesses like Ebola, cholera and yellow fever. The study also points to the significant economic benefits of vaccination programmes, which run into billions of dollars. Researchers say this is the first comprehensive study to assess the impact of emergency vaccination programmes in response to the outbreak of five infectious diseases – Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. They studied 210 different incidents from 2000 to 2023, covering 49 different countries. The vaccine roll-outs seem to have had an impressive impact, reducing deaths by nearly 60%. The number of overall cases of these infections were also reduced by nearly 60%. The swift deployment of vaccines also appears to have halted wider outbreaks. There were economic benefits too – worth an estimated $32 billion. These benefits come mainly from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability. But researchers believe this could be a significant underestimate of overall savings, as it doesn't take into account the costs of dealing with a wider outbreak, or the economic disruption caused by a more serious health emergency. It's believed the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which occurred before the existence of an approved vaccine, is estimated to have cost West African countries alone more than $53 billion. The power of vaccines The study was backed by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which was responsible for many of the programmes. Dr Sania Nishtar, the organisation's CEO, says the study shows just how important quick and effective vaccine roll-outs can be. \"For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases. \"This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective counter-measure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks. \"It also underscores the importance of fully funding Gavi, so it can continue to protect communities in the next five years to come.\" Gavi is currently trying to secure a fresh round of funding in the face of global cuts to foreign aid.

      "body": "Surgeon banned by private practice is working for NHS 5 days ago Share Save Michael Buchanan Social Affairs Correspondent Charlotte Rowles BBC News Share Save BBC Marc Lamah has not responded to the BBC A surgeon banned from working for a private healthcare company, following an investigation into patient safety, continues to work in the NHS, the BBC has learned. Nuffield Health has stopped Marc Lamah from working in their hospitals, but he is still operating on patients for the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust. An NHS patient left with a twisted bowel following an operation he carried out said he should never work again. Mr Lamah did not respond to the BBC's request for comment sent via his employer. In January the BBC revealed concerns had been raised about Mr Lamah's complication rate and that he was no longer practising at Nuffield Health's hospital in Brighton pending an investigation. A former employee at the hospital told the BBC that internal data showed one third of Mr Lamah's patients had experienced a \"moderate harm event\", where, for instance, a patient had to be transferred to another hospital or re-admitted, over a 12-month period. The figure should be 5%, the BBC was told. The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton has been at the centre of several recent controversies In a statement to the BBC, Nuffield Health said following an independent investigation, \"we can confirm Mr Lamah's practicing privileges with Nuffield Health have been withdrawn. \"His conduct did not meet the standards of medical practice and governance we expect. Patient safety is our top priority, and we hold all consultants to the highest standards.\" Mr Lamah continues to operate as a colorectal surgeon at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. The University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, told the BBC it had audited Mr Lamah's NHS data, which showed his outcomes were within the expected national range. The trust added that Nuffield's investigation had found \"no concerns with regard to technical abilities, surgical practice or patient safety\". The trust is at the centre of a large police investigation, Operation Bramber, looking into at least 200 cases of alleged medical negligence. Sussex Police is examining concerns about avoidable harm and cover-ups in the trust's neurosurgery and general surgery departments between 2015 and 2021. The trust runs seven hospitals across East and West Sussex and is one of the largest organisations within the NHS, providing care to a population of almost two million people. Sheryl Hunter says she suffered \"five years of hell\" after complications following bowel surgery by Marc Lamah Sheryl Hunter says she has suffered \"five years of hell\" after an NHS operation carried out by Mr Lamah. She has to manually evacuate her bowels and has needed several emergency admissions. After suffering from endometriosis for a number of years, in 2019 doctors decided that Ms Hunter, a mother of one, needed an operation to ease her pain. Mr Lamah decided the best approach was to remove a part of her large intestine, the colon, and connect it to her small intestine. A few days after she was discharged, said Ms Hunter, \"I felt something pop, and this very awful fluid was coming out of me\". She was rushed back to the Royal Sussex where they discovered the joint between the two intestines had torn, and \"for 10 days it had been filling up my abdomen with bowel matter.\" This is a known complication of this type of surgery, the BBC understands. Cases double in NHS trust death and injury investigation Families back hospital trust manslaughter probe Despite that problem being resolved, Ms Hunter continued to suffer extreme pain for several years, necessitating repeated visits to both her GP and the Royal Sussex hospital. She said: \"I have very little good days. By that, I mean I am curled up in a ball crying. \"When I try to go to the toilet, I scream on the toilet in tears because it is so painful to go, to open up my bowels. I have to manually do that, which means I have to wear gloves. \"The pain is very severe – it's in my stomach, it gets into my spine, down my legs, my arms.\" Letters shared with the BBC by Ms Hunter show her GP wrote to Mr Lamah repeatedly requesting he see her again. In January, 2023 the GP wrote that \"we have written to you on multiple occasions to review her and discuss her options\". A few days later Mr Lamah replied to say he had not received any previous letters. But almost 12 months later, in December 2023, the GP wrote another letter urging Mr Lamah to see her. Ms Hunter told the BBC he was \"begged\" by colleagues to see her but \"he refused\". Bad Medicine: Inside the hospital trust at centre of a police investigation Finally, in April 2024, she was seen by another consultant at a different hospital run by the same trust - the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath - when she found out what was causing her pain. \"The main problem is a 180 degree twist on the small bowel causing an internal hernia and twisting the anastomosis [the surgical joint],\" said the discharge sheet given to Ms Hunter by the hospital after the procedure. \"When they did the reconnection [of the intestines], they put it on backwards,\" Sheryl said she was told. \"That [creates] a risk of rupture. If you rupture, it's a two-hour window before death. \"Had I not been manually opening my bowels for five years, they said that would have happened.\" The trust said surgical error was only presented as one of a range of possibilities. The BBC passed the details to an independent medical expert who said the twist \"certainly is a consequence of the 2019 operation\". The trust said only a further operation would confirm if Mr Lamah had made an error or whether the twist had occurred naturally. However, the damage is now more extensive than it would have been had Ms Hunter been treated earlier. She has been told she will need pelvic reconstruction surgery before she can have another operation to try to fix her intestines. She is on a waiting list for the first procedure and has spoken to Sussex Police about her experience. Former NHS colleagues have also raised concerns to the BBC about Mr Lamah, but he continues to practise at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. \"I think it's disgusting. That man shouldn't be allowed to touch any other patients,\" said Ms Hunter. \"I was told Marc Lamah has a terrible bedside manner, but he's a fantastic surgeon. \"Marc Lamar has a terrible bedside manner, and he's a terrible surgeon. He shouldn't be allowed to operate, as far as I'm concerned.\" 'Robust systems' In a statement, Prof Katie Urch, chief medical officer for the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, told the BBC: \"We can't publicly discuss an individual's care, but we absolutely understand the distress and difficulty anyone living with ongoing complex health issues can face. \"Our clinical teams are dedicated to understanding their patients' needs and providing the highest standard of care. \"Whilst no medical procedure can guarantee a successful outcome, our teams strive for the best possible results every day – and if we ever have cause to think we could have done more for a patient we have robust systems, including the routine use of independent experts, to help us learn and improve.\" More on this story Cases double in NHS trust death and injury investigation Families back hospital trust manslaughter probe Culture of fear exists at Sussex hospital - report NHS trust downgraded as staff blow whistle Police expand hospital deaths probe timeline Related internet links Royal Sussex County Hospital Brighton NHS",

      "body": "What to do if you think someone has heat exhaustion or heatstroke 1 July 2025 Share Save Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Share Save Getty Images During hot weather, it can be easy to overheat, sometimes resulting in heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Heat exhaustion is not usually serious as long as you can cool yourself down - but heatstroke is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment. Some groups, including older adults, young children and people with long-term health conditions can be particularly at risk. The body's ability to regulate temperature is not fully developed in the very young and can be reduced by illness and some medications, while being overweight or obese can also make it harder to cool down. In particular, people taking some medicines for mental health problems are warned they should be extra cautious in hot weather as some antipsychotic medications and antidepressants can make it harder to regulate temperature. What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heatstroke? Heat exhaustion happens when your body becomes too hot and struggles to regulate its temperature. An obvious sign is excessive sweating, as well as feeling very hot and unwell - which is your body's way of warning you to cool down, fast. Other symptoms include: headache dizziness and confusion loss of appetite and feeling sick cramps in the arms, legs and stomach fast breathing or pulse temperature of 38C or above being very thirsty Young children, who might not be able to tell you about how they are feeling, may become floppy and sleepy. Heat exhaustion can affect anyone, including fit and healthy people - especially if they have done strenuous exercise in high temperatures or have been drinking alcohol in the sun all day. It can come on quickly, over minutes, or gradually, over hours. Heat exhaustion can turn into heatstroke , which is a medical emergency. It means your body can no longer manage the heat and your core temperature is rising too high. You should get urgent medical help. The signs to watch for and quickly act on: feeling unwell after 30 minutes of resting in a cool place and drinking plenty of water not sweating even while feeling too hot a temperature of 40C or above fast breathing or shortness of breath feeling confused a fit (seizure) loss of consciousness not responsive What does hot weather do to the body? What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself? How do heat health alerts work? What should you do if you think someone has heat exhaustion or heatstroke? If someone has heat exhaustion : get them to rest in a cool place - such as a room with air conditioning or somewhere in the shade remove any unnecessary clothing, to expose as much of their skin as possible cool their skin - use whatever you have available, a cool, wet sponge or flannel, spray water, cold packs around the neck and armpits, or wrap them in a cool, wet sheet fan their skin while it is moist - this will help the water to evaporate, which will help their skin cool down get them to drink water - sports or rehydration drinks are fine too Stay with them until they are better. They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes. If they do not improve after 30 minutes of rest, and you think they may have heatstroke , you should get urgent medical help.

      "body": "What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself? 17 June 2025 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Warm weather can often bring high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation is emitted by the Sun and penetrates the Earth's atmosphere. Some exposure is essential for our wellbeing, but too much can cause skin damage. Is UV dangerous? UV is beneficial because it enables our skin to produce essential vitamin D. This is important for the function of bones, blood cells and our immune system. But we need to be careful about how much time we spend in the sunshine, warns Prof Dorothy Bennett, from St George's, University of London. \"Every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer. \"Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing.\" UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells. It also plays a substantial role in skin ageing, contributing to wrinkles and loosened folds. UV exposure has also been linked to eye problems , including cataracts. What is the UV index? Levels of UV radiation vary throughout the day. The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around \"solar noon\", when the sun is at its highest - usually from late morning to early afternoon. The UV Index (or UVI) is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation. Values start at zero and can rise above 10. The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur. What are the different UV levels? Countries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year. Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Majorca in Spain normally hits nine in June and July. But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually get above five, even in summer. What do the different UV levels mean for people? According to the WHO, no sun protection is required when levels are: 1-2 (low) Some sun protection is required when levels are: 6-7 (high) 3-5 (medium) Extra sun protection is required when UV levels are: 11+ (extremely high) 8-10 (very high) Children are more sensitive to UV radiation than adults, and therefore require additional protection at lower levels. WHO: Protecting against skin cancer How can you avoid UV damage? The NHS advises : spending time in the shade when the sun is strongest - between 11:00 and 15:00 from March to October in the UK covering up with suitable clothing and wearing sunglasses using sunscreen which is factor 30 or above and offers at least 4-star UVA protection on your face, neck and other areas of exposed skin reapplying sunscreen regularly - check the instructions on the bottle making sure babies and children are protected Global research shows people often miss parts of their bodies when putting on sunscreen, according to Dr Bav Shergill from the British Association of Dermatologists. \"People often forget the side of their nose - where I have seen a lot of skin cancer,\" he says. Other areas which need to be covered include the temples and the upper chest. As a guide, adults should aim to apply about six to eight teaspoons of sunscreen if covering the entire body. How does sunscreen work? What does hot weather do to the body? Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke Can you tan safely? There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan, according to the NHS. Dr Shergill recommends using self-tan products instead. \"When you tan, ultraviolet light stimulates your skin cells to produce pigment to try and protect the DNA of skin cells - but that protection is minimal - the equivalent of SP4. \"That is not much protection at all - so you can still burn very early,\" he warns. Can you burn even when it is cloudy and windy? The amount of UV reaching your skin is not driven by the daily temperature, says Dr Michaela Hegglin, from the University of Reading. \"UV levels on a bright and breezy late April day in the UK will be about the same as a warm sunny day in August.\" \"Your skin can burn just as quickly whether it's 30C or 20C,\" warns BBC Weather's BBC Weather's Helen Willetts. \"Don't be caught out on cloudy days. UV will still penetrate thin clouds - so even if you don't think it's that sunny, you can still burn.\" I have brown skin. Do I need to worry? Yes, according to Dr Shergill. \"The skin may look darker, but it doesn’t always behave that way from a protection point of view – because there are more genes at play than we think about,\" he says. \"I have, for example, seen South Asian people with skin cancer and I have seen people with dual-heritage get skin cancer.\" The broader risks of eye damage and harmful effects on the immune system from too much UV radiation affect people of all skin colour.

      "body": "What should you look for when choosing sunscreen? 30 June 2025 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Temperatures are set to be well above average in many parts of the UK, and UV levels are expected to be high. How can you protect your skin from the sun's rays and what should you do if you get burned? What do the SPF numbers mean on sunscreen? The most prominent number on sunscreen bottles is the sun protection factor or SPF. The higher the number, the greater the protection it offers. SPF tells you how much protection your sunscreen provides from UVB radiation. The number refers to how much UVB it allows in, not how much it blocks. For example, a sunscreen with SPF 15 allows one-fifteenth of the sun's rays to reach your skin, or about 7%. So it filters out about 93% percent of UVB rays while SPF 30 filters about 97%. This means if you could stay in the sun for 10 minutes unprotected without burning, SPF 15 would in theory give you 15 times that protection, or two-and-a-half hours before you would burn. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a \"satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing\". It says sunscreen should be reapplied at least every two hours, regardless of its SPF. What are UVA and UVB and what do the star ratings mean? Many brands also carry a star rating from one to five. This tells you the percentage of UVA radiation that is absorbed by the sunscreen in comparison to how much UVB is absorbed. The more stars the better. UVA and UVB refer to different wavelengths of radiation from the sun that enter the Earth's atmosphere. UVA is associated with ageing of the skin and pigmentation as well as skin cancer. It can affect human skin even through glass. UVB causes sunburn, and is linked to particular types of skin cancer - basal cell carcinoma (the most common type) and malignant melanoma. A low SPF sunscreen could have a high star rating if the ratio of UVA to UVB protection is the same as in a higher SPF product. Ideally, you want a sunscreen with a high SPF and a high star rating. What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself? What is humidity and why does it make us feel so uncomfortable? Hot weather: How to sleep in the heat How effective is the best sunscreen? These levels of protection assume sunscreen has been applied in ideal conditions. In reality, most people do not apply sunscreen perfectly, and it can rub off with sweat or while in water. Experts think most people only apply half the recommended quantity. You should not use sunscreen which is past its expiry date as it may be less effective. Getty Images EU guidance states that sunscreen should only be marketed as having sun protection of \"50+\" and not the ratings of 80 or 100 which can be found in some countries. It thinks these could be misleading about how much extra protection they provide: SPF 50 provides about 98% protection, while SPF 100 would provide less than 100%. No product provides 100% protection from the sun's rays so the advice is that everyone should cover up and seek shade when the sun is strongest. What does hot weather do to the body? Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke What about 'once-a-day' sunscreens? There are lots of \"extended wear\" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use \"once a day\". Many claim to offer protection for up to eight hours - if applied correctly. But some dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. A Which? report in 2016 criticised four of these products for not providing the protection promised. It found that after six to eight hours, the average protection offered decreased by 74%. But this claim was rejected by some of the manufacturers, who said their own testing had produced different results. Top sunscreens fail protection tests, Which? says What should you do if you get sunburned? Sunburn results in hot and sore skin which may peel after a few days. In extreme cases, skin can blister. It usually gets better within a week or so, but there are things you can do to ease the symptoms. The NHS recommends getting out of the sun as soon as possible, and keeping burned skin covered to protect it from the sun until it has fully healed. A cool shower or a damp towel can help, as can moisturising aftersun products, painkillers and drinking plenty of water. Ask your pharmacist for advice. You should not put petroleum jelly or ice on sunburned skin. You should resist scratching the burned areas and avoid tight-fitting clothes. Contact your GP or NHS 111 if your skin is blistered or swollen or you have other symptoms of heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Regularly getting sunburned can increase the risk of skin cancer.
